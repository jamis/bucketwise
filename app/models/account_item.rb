# AccountItems are almost the same as LineItems. However, a single Event may have
# multiple LineItems associated with the same account (think "split transactions"),
# and querying and aggregating those to show activity in an account would be more
# work than it really needs to be. AccountItems are basically an optimization that
# lets us show that activity more easily; each event will have exactly one AccountItem
# record for each Account that the Event references.
